As part of a collaborative group assignment, we developed a software engineering system aimed at streamlining communication and integration across various RPL (Software Engineering) systems, including Project Management, Intelligence Engineering, Intelligence Creation, and Dataset Management Systems. Our group focused specifically on the Intelligence Creation component, contributing to the efficient design and management of intelligent systems.
